# Favourite languages: a hacktober project

In honour of Hacktober, I am doing a collaborative project that looks at everyone's favourite languages from around the world. 

To participate, please create a json file with your first and last name in camelCase (e.g., johnSmith.json). Then copy and paste the [template.json](template.json) content into your json and add the appropriate information. For now, you can only add 1 favourite language. Take a look at the example entry [jillCates.json](jillCates.json) as a guideline.

Once enough data is collected, I'll create a map visualization and share with you all.
